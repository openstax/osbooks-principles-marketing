    <para id="para-00001">When Dominik Richter, Thomas Griesel, and Jessica Nilsson launched meal-kit provider <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001"><span class="red-text">HelloFresh</span></term> in October 2011, they did what many successful entrepreneurs seek to do: disrupt a market. While the idea of not having to plan and shop for dinner meals seems enticing for consumers, changing consumer behavior is a challenging task.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">HelloFresh needed to convince consumers to stop planning and shopping for meals the way they’ve always done it. The founders recognized that they needed the right combination of traditional direct and online direct marketing tools to persuade consumers to make a hard pivot.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">It <link url="https://openstax.org/r/mealkitdelivery">starts with the HelloFresh website</link>, which offers a beautifully designed, user-friendly experience that makes customizing meals, scheduling delivery, and placing orders easy and secure. HelloFresh also uses social media to drive visitors to respond to a variety of calls to action. For example, website visitors are presented with a variety of offers aimed at persuading them to try HelloFresh, including free shipping, surprise gifts, and free meals.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">HelloFresh also recognizes the power of direct mail by sending offers similar to those presented on its website and social media to targeted consumers at home via the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">US Postal Service</term>. It’s clear that there is integration between HelloFresh’s digital messaging and its direct mail pieces.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">HelloFresh has certainly reaped the rewards of an excellent direct and online direct marketing strategy. In 2021, HelloFresh led the market with more than 7.2 million subscribers.<cite id="rf-001-a" target-id="rf-001"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00001"/></cite></para>
