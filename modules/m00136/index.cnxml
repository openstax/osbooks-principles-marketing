    <para id="para-00001">According to Accenture, a global professional services company, “Sustainable organizations are purpose-led businesses which inspire their people and partners to deliver lasting financial performance, equitable impact, and societal value that earns and retains the trust of all stakeholders.”<cite id="rf-001-a" target-id="rf-001"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00001"/></cite> Sustainability is about doing business without negatively affecting society. Without sustainable practices, companies may negatively contribute to issues of the environment, inequality, and social injustice.<cite id="rf-002-a" target-id="rf-002"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00002"/></cite> Consumers, employees, and stakeholders are now holding businesses to higher standards: 74 percent of consumers agree that conducting ethical practices is an important reason to support a company or brand, 65 percent of employees believe that businesses should leave their employees better off through work, and 81 percent of sustainable investment indexes outperformed comparable benchmarks in 2020.<cite id="rf-003-a" target-id="rf-003"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00003"/></cite> According to John Streur, CEO of Calvert Research and Management, “In 2021, we see companies almost competing with one another on sustainability.”<cite id="rf-004-a" target-id="rf-004"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00004"/></cite> The proof is in the pudding. A 2021 report by the Weinreb Group found that “there were more chief sustainability officers, or CSOs, recruited in 2020 than in the previous three years combined.”<cite id="rf-005-a" target-id="rf-005"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00005"/></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00002"><emphasis effect="italics">Barron’s</emphasis>, a respected source on financial news, creates a 100 Most Sustainable Companies list each year. In 2021, the popular kitchen supply store Williams-Sonoma stood out above others on the list for the fact that its board consisted of 67 percent women.<cite id="rf-006-a" target-id="rf-006"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00006"/></cite> Williams-Sonoma Inc.’s 2021 impact report outlines that at the time of publication, 46 percent of the company’s products supported one or more of its environmental and social initiatives, and it aims to increase that amount to 75 percent by 2030.<cite id="rf-007-a" target-id="rf-007"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00007"/></cite> In 2020, Williams-Sonoma joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and aligned its corporate goals with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.<cite id="rf-008-a" target-id="rf-008"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00008"/></cite> To learn more about Williams-Sonoma’s sustainablity efforts and plans, review its <link url="https://openstax.org/r/impactreport">2021 impact report</link>, its <link url="https://openstax.org/r/sustainabilitywilliams">corporate responsibility web page</link>, and the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/williamsonoma">sustainability section of its website</link>.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">Williams-Sonoma is just one example of a company with a vision and a commitment to sustainability. Other companies known for their sustainability commitments and practices include Microsoft, VMware, Intuit, Apple, and Mastercard.<cite id="rf-009-a" target-id="rf-009"><note class="delete-me" display="inline" id="note-00009"/></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00004">In the future, all global companies must commit to, assess, and validate the goal of sustainability. Those companies that fully embrace this commitment will stand out most to consumers and achieve business success.</para>
