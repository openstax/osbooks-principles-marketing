  "taskDescription": "Your university annually evaluates the current and possible value of its strategic business units (SBUs). The university may examine its majors as SBUs, or it may examine each college, school, or division’s performance while recruiting students. Use a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix to examine the university’s business portfolio—majors may be stars, cash cows, question marks, or dogs due to past and current enrollment in those majors. (Chances are good that underperforming “dog” majors will be phased out and financial support shifted from majors that serve as cash cows to fund growth of stars or question marks.) List two majors that fit into each of the growth-share matrix quadrants.",
