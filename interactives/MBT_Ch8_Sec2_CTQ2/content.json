  "taskDescription": "Diversity marketing intelligence (DMiQ) refers to the capability of identifying, accepting, and valuing the diversity of consumers within a market and using this knowledge to tailor the marketing mix accordingly. Thus, capturing insights about consumersâ€™ heritage, experience, lifestyle, beliefs, or living situations helps explain the nuances and idiosyncrasies associated with diversity. These insights helped identify that the LGBTQIA+ community generally spends more money online and at retail stores. Additionally, the research firm Out Now estimates the LGBTQIA+ community spends more than $211 billion on travel. How can the travel industry employ DMiQ to derive more value from this group that enjoys travel and is willing to pay for it?",
