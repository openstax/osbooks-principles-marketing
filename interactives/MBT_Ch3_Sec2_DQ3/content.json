You sort through these messages, perhaps unconsciously, and decide which ones to pay attention to. This is called selective attention. Which messages are most influential right now in your life as a student? Messages regarding your social life? Personal life? Psychological factors relating to your motivation to try a new product? Cultural factors such as gender-related products? A situational factor such as a flat tire? Where would you find an example of each message?",
