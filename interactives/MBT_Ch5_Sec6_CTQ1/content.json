  "taskDescription": "Mountain Dew was introduced in 1940 and marketed as “moonshine,” complete with Willy the Hillbilly proclaiming “It’ll tickle yore innards!” Since PepsiCo acquired the brand in the 1960s, Mountain Dew has cycled through new looks, logos, slogans, packaging, flavors, and brand personalities now connected with speed and velocity rather than soda brewed in a whiskey still. Research Mountain Dew’s history and consider this question: How has Mountain Dew steadily moved away from other competitors in the soft drink industry in its positioning efforts, and do you believe this movement has grown consumers’ brand loyalty?",
